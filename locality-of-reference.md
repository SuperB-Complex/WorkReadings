# Locality of reference
 
 * the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time

basically two types:

    temporal locality
    spatial locality

1. temporal locality

    Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data, and/or resources, within a relatively small time duration

2. spatial locality

    The use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as, traversing the elements in a one-dimensional array
